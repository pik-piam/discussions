# Discussions
Questions, answers, and discussions about PIAM tools, packages, and workflows


## 👋 Welcome!
  We’re using Discussions as a place to connect with other members of our community. We hope that you:
  * Ask questions you’re wondering about.
  * Share ideas.
  * Engage with other community members.
  * Welcome others and are open-minded. Remember that this is a community we
  build together 💪.

Here are some tips 💡 for getting started with Discussions.

  🔗 If you use issue templates, **link any relevant issue templates** such as questions and community conversations to Discussions. Declutter your issues by driving community content to where they belong in Discussions. If you need help, here's a [link to the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser).

  ➡️ You can **convert issues to discussions** either individually or bulk by labels. Looking at you, issues labeled “question” or “discussion”.
